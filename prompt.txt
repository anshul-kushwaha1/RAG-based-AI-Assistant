  I am teaching web development using sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containg video title, video number, start time in seconds, the at that time:

[{"title":"Introduction to CSS","number":"14","start":450.32,"end":452.32,"text":" I gave you an exercise"},{"title":"CSS Selectors MasterClass","number":"17","start":631.6,"end":633.6,"text":" One is A-active."},{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":732.0,"end":733.0,"text":" You can learn here."},{"title":"Id & Classes in HTML","number":"9","start":257.68,"end":259.68,"text":" Let's say there are classes in that tuition."},{"title":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work","number":"1","start":1256.08,"end":1259.08,"text":" i have put video 1"}]

"where is exercise 1 taught"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that perticular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
